Data
----------
1. Data Processing
	1.1 Detecting And Eliminiating Outliers (Using Outliers Detection Methods Example : IQR)
	1.2 Detecting And Handling Missing Values
2. Feature Selection : Choosing most effective attributes in classifying the training data (Can use feature selection Methods : Filter Methor or Wrapper Method)
3. Dividing the data into training and test data.
4. Creating the model out of that.
5. Mechanism to read data from the csv/excel.

Sampling 
-----------

1. One of the main issues with the dataset used in this study is that it is imbalanced. The predication accuracy is significantly affected with imbalanced data 
(We can take a call if this step is needed or not for our dataset)

Analysis
-------------
1. Finding an algorithm for learning the trial data.
2. Implementing that algorithm.
3. Running the learning mechanism on trial data.
4. Finding an algorithm for prediction the test data.
5. Implementing that algorithm.
6. Running the prediction mechanism on test data.

Output
---------------
1. Generating the resultant prediction on the test data.
2. Generating the data graph.
3. Creating the video of the output.

Data
----------
1. Dividing the data into trial and test data.
2. Creating the model out of that.
3. Deciding on the parameters that needs to be included and excluded.
4. Mechanism to read data from the csv.

Analysis
-------------
1. Finding an algorithm for learning the trial data.
2. Implementing that algorithm.
3. Running the learning mechanism on trial data.
4. Finding an algorithm for prediction the test data.
5. Implementing that algorithm.
6. Running the prediction mechanism on test data.

Output
---------------
1. Generating the resultant prediction on the test data.
2. Generating the data graph.
3. Creating the video of the output.

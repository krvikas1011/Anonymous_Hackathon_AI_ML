Problem Statement : Predict chance of readmission (no readmission, readmission within 30 days or after 30 days) for diabetic patients.

Dataset: The data set represents 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks. It includes over 50 features representing patient and hospital outcomes.

Output required for every testing data is to categorize them in either of these 3 categories:
1. No Readmission after completion of treatment.
2. Readmission within 30 days of treatment.
3. Readmission after 30 days of treatment.


There are a total of 50 influencing factors(such as age, gender and other content levels in blood) that will play a role in prediction and that has to be learned by the system. Although there may be few things that might not be a prime influencer in the readmission for diabetes(such as admission ids, etc.).
